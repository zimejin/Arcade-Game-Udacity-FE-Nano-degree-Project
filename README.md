About
=====
The Scope for this game was to create a 2D scroller using JavaScript. I've iterated on the original project which was much simpler, And added some custom features. 
This was also a project done in submision to Udacity as part of my project requirements. 

A game engine was provided but I modified it to add additional functionality to the application. Such as a collision detection
system for when players hit an obstacle. 

How To Play
===============================
* Navigate to your local copy of index.html through your web browser

* You control the player character with the arrow keys and can move up, down, left or right

* Player must move across the board while avoiding enemy bugs.
